Annotation on reader's perception elements using LLMs
=====================================================

For my bachelor's thesis, I am doing research on the effect of reader's perception
elements on persuasion. For this, we need to annotate a large dataset of Reddit
r/ChangeMyView comments. We have annotated ~600 comments manually and will use
this code to annotate the full dataset (or at least a large part of it).

This GitHub repository contains the code used to get the annotations from the LLMs and
further processing of the annotations.
